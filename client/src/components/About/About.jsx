      <h1>What is AbuseHunters?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          AbuseHunters is a pioneering initiative dedicated to combating the
          proliferation of fake accounts on social media. Our core mission is to
          enhance online authenticity and transparency by providing a central
          hub for social media users, digital marketers, and concerned netizens
          to report and identify fake social media profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand the impact that fake accounts can have on online
          communities, from spreading misinformation to influencing public
          opinion. To address this, we offer a user-friendly platform where
          anyone can report a suspected fake account. Each report is then
          analyzed using our sophisticated scoring system, which assesses
          various indicators of authenticity to determine the likelihood of an
          account being fraudulent.
